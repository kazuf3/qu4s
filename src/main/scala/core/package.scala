/** Provides fundamental classes to define quantum circuits.
  *
  * ==Overview==
  *
  * To define a quantum circuit, the first thing needed is a com.qu4s.core.Circuit. It can be defined as an implicit
  * class instance, so that [[com.qu4s.core.Wire]] and [[com.qu4s.core.Gate]] will be deployed sequencially.
